# Rust Learning through The Book

We are all trying to learn Rust using "The Book".

Please create your own branch and NEVER merge your branch into anything else. The idea is to complete all the exercises from the book within your branch and feel confident. Once we make reasonable progress, we can discuss some specific topics where requires some clarifications. Usual suspects like ownership, burrowing, lifetimes, closures, etc. may require deep dive.
